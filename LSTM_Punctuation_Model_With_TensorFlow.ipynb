        "This notebook walks you through the creation of an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The model can be used to insert punctuations automatically on paragraphs without punctuations. For example, given:\n",

I think both are extracted from the proceedings of the European Parliament. I chose these two datasets because first they have clean punctuations, and second they are large enough to create a decent model."
